        <h3>Collisions:</h3>
        <li>What about when objects collide? What's the math behind that? Objects have momentum. Momentum is what abides by Newton's First Law "An object in motion will stay in motion, and an object at rest will stay at rest, unless acted upon by an external
            force" that external net force is what changes the momentum.</li>
        <li>Momentum (
            <equation><var>p</var></equation>) is defined with:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <equation><var>p = m</var>V</equation>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <equation>&Delta;<var>p = m</var>&Delta;V = <var>F</var>&Delta;<var>t</var></equation>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>What those formulas mean is that momentum at an instant is equal to mass (
            <equation><var>m</var></equation>) times velocity (
            <equation>V</equation>), but change in momentum (aka impulse) can be defined with either mass (
            <equation><var>m</var></equation>) times change in velocity over time (
            <equation>&Delta;V</equation>) or a Net Force (
            <equation><var>F</var></equation>) applied over a certain interval of time (
            <equation><var>t</var></equation>).</li>
        <li>This means that unless there is an external force applied, momentum is conserved. Whenever attacking collision problems, always try using a momentum approach first. If momentum is conserved in a collision of two objects, you can use</li>

        <h5>Energy in Collisions:</h5>
        <li>When two objects collide, either two things can happen, for the most part, energy can also be conserved, or energy can be lost.</li>
        <li>Elastic collisions are when the kinetic energies before and after the collision are the same, yet even then, there are no such things as "perfectly elastic collisions". However, this is not always the case, and it is not safe to assume that all
            collisions are elastic, so use the momentum approach first.</li>
        <li>Energy is conserved in a system when there are no external forces and no internal energy conversion (so when blocks stick together, those collisions are usually inelastic).</li>
        <table class="rules">

        <li>Notice the question mark (?), that signifies that you must check to see if they are equal, because they might not be, some of the energy could escape as forms of energy other than mechanical energy.</li>
