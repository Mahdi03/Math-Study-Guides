        <li>Another approach to problems is the energy side of things, especially when the force is not constant, such as in springs and pendulums.</li>
        <li>You may already know that energy is never created or destroyed, it is conserved and transformed into things like heat (thermal) energy, kinetic energy (energy of movement) or potential energy (built-up energy). The focus of this course will be
            on the latter two.</li>
        <li>Kinetic Energy (in a linear sense) and Potential Energy are defined as follows:</li>
