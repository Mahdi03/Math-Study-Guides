    <ul>
        <li>Forces are another type of movement measured with vectors, so the same vector properties of displace, velocity, and acceleration also apply.</li>
        <li>Force is defined by
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td><var>F = ma</var></td>
                </tr>
            </table> where <var>m</var> is the mass of the object or system in kilograms (kg) and <var>a</var> is the acceleration of the object or system in meters per second per second (m/s<sup>2</sup>).</li>
        <li>Force is measured in kgm/s<sup>2</sup>, or Newtons (N).</li>
        <h5>Newton's 3 Laws of Motion:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>An object in motion will stay in motion, and an object at rest will stay at rest, unless acted upon by an external force.</li>
            <li>The acceleration of an object is proportional to the force (the aforementioned mathematical definition of force <var>F = ma</var>).</li>
            <li>For every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. (So if you push the wall then the wall is pushing you back at the same force).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Newton's third law of motion can be used to describe weight and Normal Force (<var>F<sub>n</sub></var>). When you sit on a chair, your weight (described as the acceleration due to gravity (<var>g</var>) times the mass of the object, you) <var>mg</var>            is being counteracted by the chair by an equal force, that way you aren't falling but at the same time that way you aren't levitating. This force that the chair counteracts at is known as the Normal Force.</li>
        <h3>Friction:</h3>
        <li>Objects can also experience friction, whether they do will be dictated in the problem if necessary.</li>
        <li>Friction can be quanitified with forces, we call this the Force of Friction, usually denoted by <var>F<sub>f</sub></var>. In order for friction to exist, there must be a stickiness between two objects that rub against each other, and this is quantified
            with a coefficient of friction (<var>&mu;</var>) that has no units. This value really only represents how rough the surface is, and how prone it is to cause friction in the formula
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td><var>F<sub>f</sub> = &mu;F<sub>n</sub></var></td>
                </tr>
            </table> where <var>&mu;</var> is the coefficient of friction and <var>F<sub>n</sub></var> is the Normal Force exerted by the surface on the object (equal to the force of the object on the surface).
        </li>
        <li>Friction itself cannot move an object, its only element is that it impedes applied forces from moving an object. So if you push an object with 150N, but its Force of Friction is 200N, then the object will not move, and its acceleration will be
            0. If the Force of Friction is 100N however, then the object will be moving with a Net Force of 50N in the direction at which you push.</li>
        <li>Net Force is defined as the sum of all parallel forces (
            <sigma></sigma><var>F</var>).</li>
    </ul>
