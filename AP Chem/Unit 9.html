    <h3>Entropy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Entropy, represented by <var>S</var>, describes the randomness and disorder of a system. 0 entropy is defined as a solid crystal at 0 K. Standard entropies are calculated at 25&deg;C.</li>
        <li>
            Standard entropy (of a chemical reaction; \(n_p, n_r\) represent moles of products and reactants respectively):

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>The second law of thermodynamics states: in any spontaneous process there is always an increase in the entropy of the universe. Thus, entropy
            is not conserverd.</li>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>If \(\Delta S_{univ}\) is positive, entropy increases and the process it decribes is spontaneous in the direction written. If \(\Delta S_{univ}\) is negative, then the process
            is spontaneous in the opposite direciton. If \(\Delta S_{univ}\) is 0, then the process will not occur spontaneously and the system is at equilibrium.
        </li>
        <li>The sign of entropy changes in the surroundings are primarily determined by heat flow: exothermic processes increase surrounding entropy and endothermic is the opposite.
            The magnitude of surrounding entropy depends on temperature.

        <ul>
            <li>In these types of redox reactions, water molecules, protons, or hydroxide ions may be needed to balance the equations.
                Here is how to balance such equations:

            <ol>
                <li>Write separate equatiosn for the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.</li>

                        <li>balance all the elements except hydrogen and oxygen.</li>
                        <li>balance oxygen using \(\ce{H2O}\)</li>
                        <li>balance hydrogen using \(\ce{H+}\)</li>
                        <li>balance charge using electrons</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If necessary, multiply one or both half-reactions by an integer to equalize the number of electrons transferred.</li>
                <li>Add the half-reactions, and cancel identical species.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Example: The following equation is not balanced. <br>
                \(\ce{Cu(s) + NO3-(aq) -> Cu^2+(aq) NO2(g)}\) <br>
                Write the half-reactions, <br>
                Oxidation: \(\ce{Cu(s) -> Cu^2+(aq)}\) <br>
                Reduction: \(\ce{NO3-(aq) -> NO2(g)}\) <br>
                Now, balance each half reaction, <br>
                Oxidation: \(\ce{Cu(s) -> Cu^2+(aq) + 2e-}\) <br>
                Reduction: <br>

                    \(\ce{NO3-(aq) + 2H+(aq) + e- -> NO2(g) + H2O(l)}\) (The net charge on both sides is now 0) <br>
                </div>
                Now we must equalize the number of electrons transferred: <br>
                Reduction: \(\ce{2NO3-(aq) + 4H+(aq) + 2e- -> 2NO2(g) + 2H2O(l)}\) <br>
                Summing both reactions yields us: <br>
                \(\ce{Cu(s) + 2NO3-(aq) + 4H+(aq) -> Cu^2+(aq) + 2NO2(g) + 2H2O(l)}\)

        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the half-reaction method as in acidic solutions (we are assuming that hydrogen ions are present).</li>
                <li>To both sides of the equation affected, add a number of hydroxide ions that is equal to the number of hydrogen ions. This will
                    eliminate the hydrogen ions by forming water.
                </li>
                <li>Form water on the side containing both hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and eliminate the number of water molecules that appear
                    on both sides of the equation.
                </li>
                <li>Check that elements and charges are balanced.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Example: The following reaction is not balanced. <br>
                \(\ce{Ag(s) + CN-(aq) + O2(g) ->[Base] Ag(CN)2-(aq)}\) <br>
                Oxidation:

                    \(\ce{4e- + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) -> 2H2O(l)}\) <br>
                </div>
                After multiplying the oxidation half-reaction by 4, the complete, balanced reaciton is: <br>
                \(\ce{8CN-(aq) + 4Ag(s) + O2(g) +} \underbrace{\ce{4H+(aq) + 4OH-(aq)}}_{\ce{4H2O(l)}} \ce{-> 4Ag(CN)2-(aq) + 2H2O(l) + 4OH-(aq)}\) <br>
                After eliminating the water molecules from both sides: <br>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Galvanic Cells:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A favored redox reaction is used to generate a flow of <strong>current</strong> (the flow of electrons). As shown in the figure below, two half-reactions take place in separate chambers, and electrons are
            released by the oxidation reaction pass through the wire to the reduction reaction's chamber. Oxidation takes place at the electrode called the <strong>anode</strong>
            and reduction takes place at the <strong>cathode</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality in the cell. At the cathode, reduction occurs causing the solution to become less positively charged,
            so positive cations from the salt bridge solution flow into the half-cell. The opposite happens at the anode.
        </li>
        <img src="galvanic_cell.png" width="40%"/>
        <li>
            For electrochemical cells, we use <strong>line notation</strong> and in this notation the anode components are listed on the left and the cathode components are listed on the right.
            As shown above, phase difference is indicated by a single line. The substance constituting the anode is on the far left and the substance constituting the cathode is on the far right.
            Double lines separate the anode and cathode.
        </li>
        <li>For an electrochemical cell containing ions (an aqueous solution) instead of a solid, platinum (a non-reactive, conducting metal) can be used to serve as an electrode. Thus,
            the line notation will contain commas separating the components of the half-reaction and a line separating those from platinum. Here is an electrochemical cell using two non-solid
            substances:<br>
            \(\ce{Pt(s)|ClO3-(aq), ClO4-(aq), H+(aq)||H+(aq), MnO4-(aq), Mn2+(aq)|Pt(s)}\)
        </li>
        <h5>Reduction Potential:</h5>
            <li>
                The driving force on electrons in a ce ll is called the <strong>cell potential</strong> (\(E_{cell}\)) and is measured in volts (a volt is defined as 1 joule of work
                per coulomb of charge transferred). \(E^{\circ}\) has a superscript indicating that standard states are used (1 atm gases and 1 M solutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Each half-reaction in a redox reaction is assigned a half-cell potential. The half-reaction of \(\ce{2H+ + 2e- -> H2}\) is defined to have a half-cell potential of 0 V.
                Convention: potentials of half-reactions are given as reduction processes (so you would see an electron being in the reactant side). Because the oxidation process is written
                as a reduction process, the cell potential is given by:
                <table class="rules">
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            \(E^{\circ}_{cell} = E^{\circ}_{cathode} - E^{\circ}_{anode}\)
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> although half-reactions may not have equal amounts of electrons if they are unbalanced, standard reduction potential is an intensive property so therefore
            it does not depend on how many times the reaction occurs. (Do not multiply the potential by any integer when balancing a redox reaction). Also, the sign of the cell potential flips
            when the reaction is flipped.</li>
            <li>A fast way to determine which half-reaction should go first is to see which order of half-cell potentials will yield a positive cell potiental. Only a positive one will
                create a spontaneous reaction.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Electrolytic Cells:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An electrolytic cell uses an outside source of voltage to force an unfavored redox reaction to take place. Most occur in aqueous solutions and either ions or the water molecules can be reduced
            oxidized.
        </li>
        <li>Example: <br>
            For a reaction involving an aqueous solution of nickel (II) chloride in water, we must determine which substance is reduced and which is oxidized. <br>
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{Ni^2+ + 2e- -> Ni(s) \quad E^{\circ} = -0.25 V}\) <br>
                \(\ce{2H2O(l) + 2e- -> H2O(g) + 2OH- \quad E^{\circ} = -0.80 V}\)
            </div>
            Since the half-reaction involving nickel has a higher voltage, it is more favored. It will occur over the one involving water. <br>
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{2Cl- -> Cl2(g) + 2e- \quad E^{\circ} = -1.36 V}\) <br>
                \(\ce{2H2O(l) -> O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e- \quad E^{\circ} = -1.23 V}\)
            </div>
            Since the half-reaction for water has a higher voltage, it is more favored. <br>
            Thus, the complete redox reaction is:
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{2Ni^2+ + 2H2O(l) -> 2Ni(s) + O2(g) + 4H+}\) <br>
                \(E = -0.25 V + -1.24 V = -1.49 V\)
            </div>

            The total cell potential in an electrolytic cell is always negative as an outside source (like a battery) is needed to power the reaction. They usually use two non-reactive
            metal bars as electrodes since the components are aqueous or water.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Electroplating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Electroplating refers how metal ions will congregate on the surface of the cathode or where the reduced half-reaction takes place. This process is usually implemented in
            an electrolytic cell.
        </li>
        <li>The most common problem type asks you to find how much a component "plates out" or congregates on an electrode (usually in grams). First, the idea of current is needed 
            to find this amount:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(I = \dfrac{q}{t}\) <br>
                        <div style="text-align: left">
                            \(I\) = current (amperes, A) <br>
                            \(q\) = charge (coulombs, C) <br>
                            \(t\) =  time (seconds, s)
                        </div>
                        
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            Faraday's constant will also be needed:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>\(F = 96485 \frac{C}{mol}\)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            It represents the charge of 1 mole of electrons.
        </li>
        <li>Using those equations, you can figure out how many moles of electrons are produced or needed in a reaction with a given current and time. Also, utilizing stoichiometry (not forgetting the coefficient
            on the electron), you can find the mass of any redox component.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Voltage and Favorability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> For standard conditions,
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(\Delta G^{\circ} = -nFE^{\circ}\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            Basically, the maximum cell potential is directly proportional to the free energy difference between
            reactants and products in the cell. \(n\) represents the number of moles of electrons exchanged in the reaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Concentration</strong>: by Le Châtelier's principle, an increase in the concentration of the reactants will favor the favor reaction and thus increase
            flow of electrons. Thus, cell potential will increase. An increase in concentration of the product will oppose the forward reaction and thus decrease the cell potential.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because of concentration, it is possible to produce a positive voltage with the same component in two different half-cells at different concentrations (a concentration cell).
            The half-cell with less concentration will donate electrons to the half-cell with more concentration in order to increase its concentration of ions and decrease the half-cell's.
        </li>
        <h5>THe Nernst Equation:</h5>
        <li>
            Using the equation: \(\Delta G = \Delta G^{\circ} + RT \ln (Q)\), we can use the equation above to find a relationship for voltage and concentration.
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(E = E^{\circ} - \dfrac{RT}{nF} \ln (Q)\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            The cell potential calcuated with this equation is the maximum potential before any current flows. Thus, as current does flow, concentrations change and so an equilibrium
            will be reached. The cell will spontaneously discharge until it reaches equilibrium. <br>
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(Q = K \quad \text{and} \quad E_{cell} = 0\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            The battery becomes dead, the components have the same free energy and the cell no longer has the ability to do work.
