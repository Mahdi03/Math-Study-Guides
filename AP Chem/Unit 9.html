    <h3>Entropy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Entropy, represented by \(S\), describes the randomness and disorder of the system. 0 entropy is defined as a solid crystal at 0 K. Standard entropies are calculated
            at \(25^{\circ}\).
        </li>
        <li>
            Standard entropy chance:

                <tr>
                    <td>\(\Delta S^{\circ} = \sum \Delta S^{\circ}_{products} - \sum \Delta S^{\circ}_{reactants} \)</td>
                </tr>

    </ul>
    <h3>Gibb's Free Energy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Gibb's free energy</strong>, \(G\), is the measure of whether or not a process will proceed without input of outside energy.
            A process that proceeds without outside energy is called <strong>thermodynamically favored</strong> while the opposite is unfavored (also called spontaneous and nonspontaneous respectively).
        </li>
        <h5>Free Energy Chance, \(\Delta G^{\circ}\):</h5>
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(\Delta G^{\circ} = \sum \Delta G^{\circ}_{f \text{ } products} - \sum \Delta G^{\circ}_{f \text{ } reactants}\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <li>
                If \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is negative, reaction is thermodynamically favored.
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is positive, the reaction is thermodynamically unfavored.
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(\Delta G^{\circ}\) is 0, the reaction is at equillibrium.
            </li>
        <h5>\(\Delta G, \Delta H, \text{and } \Delta S\):</h5>
        <li>
            Nature likes to move toward low energy and high disorder, so thermodynamically favored processes result in decreasing enthalpy or increasing enrtopy or both. The following equation links these energies together:
        </li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    \(\Delta G^{\circ} = \Delta H^{\circ} - T\Delta S^{\circ}\)
                    <br>
                    \(T\) = absolute temperature (K)
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <li>
            Here's an example: <br> <br>
            \(\ce{CO(g) + H2O(g) -> CO2(g) + H2(g) \quad \Delta H^{\circ} = -41.2 kJ/mol \quad \Delta S^{\circ} = -135 J/mol\cdot K}\)
            <br>
            <br>
            (a) Is the above reaction thermodynamically favorable at \(\ce{25^{\circ}C}\)?
            <br>
            (b) At what temperature would the reaction no longer be thermodynamically favored? Assume the enthalpy and entropy values are independent of temperature.

            <div id="gibbsFreeEnergyExample" class="solution">
                (a)  \(\ce{\Delta G^{\circ} = (-41.2 kJ/mol) - (298 K)(-0.135 kJ/mol\cdot K)}\)
                <br>
                \(\quad \ce{\Delta G^{\circ} = -0.97 kJ/mol}\)
                <br>
                (b) Set the gibbs energy to 0.
                <br>
                \(\quad \ce{0=(-41.2 kJ/mol) - (T)(-0.135 kJ/mol\cdot K)}\)
                <br>
                \(\quad T = 305 K\), thus its dynamically unfavorable if it is above that temperature.

        <h5>\(\Delta G^{\circ}\) and Phase Changes:</h5>
        <li>
            Since phase changes are not chemical reactions, their free energy is 0. So, we can determine substance's melting or boiling points.
        </li>
        <h5>Standard Free Energy Change and the Equilibrium Constant:</h5>
        <li>
            Free energy can be calculated if you know the equilibrium constant:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(\Delta G^{\circ} = -RT\ln K\)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        \(R\) = the gas constant, 8.31 J/molK <br>
                        \(T\) = absolute temperature (K) <br>
                        \(K\) = the equilibrium constant
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <h5>Reduction Potentials:</h5>
        <li>
            Every half-reaction has a voltage. You will be given the values for the standard reduction potential for any question regarding it. They are always
            given as reduciton half-reactions, reading the reaction in reverse and flipping the sign will give the oxidatio potential. <br>
            The larger the potential, the more likely it is to occur.
            When calculating the potential of a reox reaction remember:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add the potention for the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Never multiply the potential for a half-reaction by a coefficient.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                When a solid metal is placed into a metallic solution and a new solid forms, the reduction potential of the metal in solution is greater
                than that of the solid meta. If no solid forms, the reduciton potential of the solid metal is higher.
            </li>
        </li>
    </ul>
