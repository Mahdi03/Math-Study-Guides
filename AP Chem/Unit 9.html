    <h3>Entropy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Entropy, represented by <var>S</var>, describes the randomness and disorder of the system. 0 entropy is defined as a solid crystal at 0 K. Standard entropies are calculated at 25&deg;C.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gibb's free energy</strong>,
            <equation><var>G</var></equation>, is the measure of whether or not a process will proceed without input of outside energy. A process that proceeds without outside energy is called <strong>thermodynamically favored</strong> while the opposite is unfavored
            (also called spontaneous and nonspontaneous, respectively).</li>

        <h5>&Delta;G, &Delta;H, and &Delta;S:</h5>
        <li>Nature likes to move toward low energy and high disorder (entropy), so thermodynamically-favored processes result in decreasing enthalpy or increasing entropy or both. The following equation links these energies together:</li>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>Is the above reaction thermodynamically favorable at 25&deg;C?</li>
                <li>At what temperature would the reaction no longer be thermodynamically favored? Assume the enthalpy and entropy values are independent of temperature.</li>

                <li>Set the gibbs energy to 0 and then solve.</li>
                \(\quad \ce{0=(-41.2 kJ/mol) - (T)(-0.135 kJ/mol\cdot K)}\)<br /> \(\quad T = 305 K\), thus its dynamically unfavorable if it is above that temperature.

        <h5>&Delta;G&deg; and Phase Changes:</h5>
        <li>Since phase changes are not chemical reactions, their free energy is 0. So, we can determine a substance's melting or boiling points.</li>
        <h5>Standard Free Energy Change and the Equilibrium Constant:</h5>
        <li>Free energy can be calculated if you know the equilibrium constant using the following equation, where <var>R</var> is the gas constant, <var>T</var> = absolute temperature in Kelvin (K), and <var>K</var> is the equilibrium constant:</li>
        <table class="rules">

        <h5>Reduction Potentials:</h5>
        <li>Every half-reaction has a voltage. You will be given the values for the standard reduction potential for any question regarding it. They are always given as reduction half-reactions, reading the reaction in reverse and flipping the sign will give
            the oxidation potential.</li>
        <li>The larger the potential, the more likely it is to occur. When calculating the potential of a redox reaction remember:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the potential for the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction half-reaction.</li>
            <li>Never multiply the potential for a half-reaction by a coefficient.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When a solid metal is placed into a metallic solution and a new solid forms, the reduction potential of the metal in solution is greater than that of the solid metal. If no solid forms, the reduction potential of the solid metal is higher.</li>
