    <h3>Galvanic Cells:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A favored redox reaction is used to generate a flow of <strong>current</strong> (the flow of electrons). As shown in the figure below, two half-reactions take place in separate chambers, and electrons are released by the oxidation reaction pass
            through the wire to the reduction reaction's chamber. Oxidation takes place at the electrode called the <strong>anode</strong> and reduction takes place at the <strong>cathode</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The salt bridge maintains electrical neutrality in the cell. At the cathode, reduction occurs causing the solution to become less positively charged, so positive cations from the salt bridge solution flow into the half-cell. The opposite happens at the
            anode.
        </li>
        <img src="galvanic_cell.png" width="40%" />
        <li>
            For electrochemical cells, we use <strong>line notation</strong> and in this notation the anode components are listed on the left and the cathode components are listed on the right. As shown above, phase difference is indicated by a single
            line. The substance constituting the anode is on the far left and the substance constituting the cathode is on the far right. Double lines separate the anode and cathode.
        </li>
        <li>For an electrochemical cell containing ions (an aqueous solution) instead of a solid, platinum (a non-reactive, conducting metal) can be used to serve as an electrode. Thus, the line notation will contain commas separating the components of the
            half-reaction and a line separating those from platinum. Here is an electrochemical cell using two non-solid substances:
            <br /> \(\ce{Pt(s)|ClO3^-(aq), ClO2^-(aq), H+(aq)||H+(aq), MnO2^-(aq), Mn2+(aq)|Pt(s)}\)
        </li>
        <h5>Reduction Potential:</h5>
        <li>
            The driving force on electrons in a cell is called the <strong>cell potential</strong> (\(E_{cell}\)) and is measured in volts (a volt is defined as 1 joule of work per coulomb of charge transferred). \(E^{\circ}\) has a superscript indicating
            that standard states are used (1 atm gases and 1 M solutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Each half-reaction in a redox reaction is assigned a half-cell potential. The half-reaction of \(\ce{2H+ + 2e^- -> H2}\) is defined to have a half-cell potential of 0 V. Convention: potentials of half-reactions are given as reduction processes (so you
            would see an electron being in the reactant side). Because the oxidation process is written as a reduction process, the cell potential is given by:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <equation>E&deg;<sub><text>cell</text></sub> = E&deg;<sub><text>cathode</text></sub> &minus; E&deg;<sub><text>anode</text></sub></equation>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Note:</strong> although half-reactions may not have equal amounts of electrons if they are unbalanced, standard reduction potential is an intensive property so therefore it does not depend on how many times the reaction occurs. (Do not
            multiply the potential by any integer when balancing a redox reaction). Also, the sign of the cell potential flips when the reaction is flipped.</li>
        <li>A fast way to determine which half-reaction should go first is to see which order of half-cell potentials will yield a positive cell potential. Only a positive one will create a spontaneous reaction.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Electrolytic Cells:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An electrolytic cell uses an outside source of voltage to force an unfavored redox reaction to take place. Most occur in aqueous solutions and either ions or the water molecules can be reduced oxidized.
        </li>
        <li>Example: <br /> For a reaction involving an aqueous solution of nickel (II) chloride in water, we must determine which substance is reduced and which is oxidized. <br />
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{Ni^2+ + 2e^- -> Ni(s) \quad E^{\circ} = -0.25 V}\) <br /> \(\ce{2H2O(l) + 2e^- -> H2O(g) + 2OH^- \quad E^{\circ} = -0.80 V}\)
            </div>
            Since the half-reaction involving nickel has a higher voltage, it is more favored. It will occur over the one involving water. <br />
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{2Cl^- -> Cl2(g) + 2e^- \quad E^{\circ} = -1.36 V}\) <br /> \(\ce{2H2O(l) -> O2(g) + 4H+ + 4e^- \quad E^{\circ} = -1.23 V}\)
            </div>
            Since the half-reaction for water has a higher voltage, it is more favored. <br /> Thus, the complete redox reaction is:
            <div class="indent">
                \(\ce{2Ni^2+ + 2H2O(l) -> 2Ni(s) + O2(g) + 4H+}\) <br /> \(E = -0.25 V + -1.24 V = -1.49 V\)
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            The total cell potential in an electrolytic cell is always negative as an outside source (like a battery) is needed to power the reaction. They usually use two non-reactive metal bars as electrodes since the components are aqueous or water.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Electroplating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Electroplating refers how metal ions will congregate on the surface of the cathode or where the reduced half-reaction takes place. This process is usually implemented in an electrolytic cell.</li>
        <li>The most common problem type asks you to find how much a component "plates out" or congregates on an electrode (usually in grams). First, the idea of current is needed to find this amount. Current is defined as the change in charge
            <equation><var>&Delta;Q</var></equation> over time
            <equation><var>t</var></equation>. We write this as:</li>

        <li>Faraday's constant gives us the charge of 1 mole of electrons:</li>

        </table>
        <li>Using these equations, we can figure out how many moles of electrons are produced or needed in a reaction with a given current and time. Also, utilizing stoichiometry (not forgetting the coefficient on the electron), you can find the mass of any
            redox component.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Voltage and Favorability:</h3>

        <li> For standard conditions,

            </table>
            Basically, the maximum cell potential is directly proportional to the free energy difference between reactants and products in the cell.
            <equation><var>n</var></equation> represents the number of moles of electrons exchanged in the reaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Concentration</strong>: by Le Ch&acirc;telier's principle, an increase in the concentration of the reactants will favor the favor reaction and thus increase flow of electrons. Thus, cell potential will increase. An increase in concentration
            of the product will oppose the forward reaction and thus decrease the cell potential.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because of concentration, it is possible to produce a positive voltage with the same component in two different half-cells at different concentrations (a concentration cell). The half-cell with less concentration will donate electrons to the half-cell
            with more concentration in order to increase its concentration of ions and decrease the half-cell's.
        </li>
        <h5>The Nernst Equation:</h5>
        <li>
            Using the equation:

                <var>RT</var>
                <ln>Q</ln>
            </equation>, we can use the equation above to find a relationship for voltage and concentration.

            The cell potential calculated with this equation is the maximum potential before any current flows. Thus, as current does flow, concentrations change and so an equilibrium will be reached. The cell will spontaneously discharge until it reaches equilibrium.

            The battery becomes dead, the components have the same free energy and the cell no longer has the ability to do work.
