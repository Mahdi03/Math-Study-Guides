    <h3>Bonds Overview:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In order from strongest to weakest:</li>
        <!--<h3>Chemical Bonds:</h3>-->
        <ul>
            <li><u><b>Ionic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, but becomes a conductor when melted or dissolved in water.</li>
            <li><u><b>Covalent Molecular:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a low melting point.</li>
            <li><u><b>Covalent Network:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a high melting point</li>
            <li><u><b>Metallic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that is a good conductor of electricity. At the particle level, a metal consists of a crystal lattice of positive particles that consist of the nucleus and the core electrons, with a “sea” of delocalized
                valence electrons that can move freely throughout the lattice</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <h3>Ionic Bonds:</h3>

        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Metallic Bonds:</h3>

    </ul>
    <h3>Covalent Bonds:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lewis Dot Structures:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Here's some guideline steps on how to draw Lewis Structures:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the Total Number of Valence Electrons</li>
            <li>Find the Number of Electrons Needed to Make the Atoms "Happy" (complete the octet rule)</li>
            <li>Determine the Number of Bonds in the Molecule.</li>
            <li>Choose a Central Atom.</li>
            <li>Draw a Skeletal Structure.</li>
            <li>Place Electrons Around Outside Atoms.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Formal Charge:</h5>

        <li>With Lewis Structures we like to calculate the charge of each element if they all equally shared electrons. We can calculate the formal charge of each element in a Lewis Structure in many ways:</li>
        <img src="https://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch01/formalcharge00.gif" />
        <li>Smaller former charges are preferable to larger charges, however, most preferred would be that all atoms have a formal charge of 0</li>
        <li>We like to avoid like charges on adjacent atoms</li>
        <li>A more negative formal charge should be on the most electronegative atom</li>

        <h5>VSEPR and Molecular Geometry:</h5>

        <li>VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion, and when we draw Lewis Structures we only take into account the valence electrons.</li>
        <li>VSEPR says that electrons exist in pairs and these pairs repel each other to be as far apart as possible. We call these electron domains, and that's the same as the steric number. Basically just count how many things are attached to the central
            atom(s).

        <li>Here's a chart you should have memorized:</li>
