        <ul>
            <li><u><b>Ionic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, but becomes a conductor when melted or dissolved in water.</li>
            <li><u><b>Covalent Molecular:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a low melting point.</li>
            <li><u><b>Covalent Network:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a high melting point</li>
            <li><u><b>Metallic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that is a good conductor of electricity. At the particle level, a metal consists of a crystal lattice of positive particles that consist of the nucleus and the core electrons, with a “sea” of delocalized
                valence electrons that can move freely throughout the lattice</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Types of Solids:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><u>Ionic Solids:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These have relatively high melting and boiling points</li>
                <li>They only conduct electricity when melted or aqueous because of mobile ions</li>
                <li>Brittle solid because of repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer</li>
            </ul>
        </li
        <!-4. Structure of Metals and Alloys->
        <li>
            <b><u>Metallic Solids:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These are great conductors of electricity because a metal consists of a crystal lattice of positive particles that consist of the nucleus and core electrons, with a “sea” of delocalized electrons that move freely throughout the lattice.</li>
                <li>They are also ductile and malleable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Covalent Network:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>This is when atoms are covalently bonded in a 3D network</li>
                <li>They are built-up of Many strong covalent bonds, which is why they are very hard and have high melting points. Some examples include Diamonds or
                    <compound>SiO2</compound>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Covalent Molecular:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These are composed of distinct, individual molecules that are attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces.</li>
                <li>They have relatively low melting points because of weak IMF's.</li>
                <li>They cannot conduct electricity because valence electrons are held tightly within the covalent bonds of each molecule.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<h3>Alloys:</h3> <!-Structure of Metals and Alloys->
    <li>An interstitial alloy is formed between two elements in which there is a significant difference between two atomic radius of each element (steel)</li>
    <li>A substitutional alloy is formed between two elements in which the atomic radius of each element is very similar; atoms of one elements are substituted for the other (brass)</li>

    <h3>Lewis Dot Structures:</h3>
    <!--5. Lewis Diagrams-->
    <ul>
        <li>Here's some guideline steps on how to draw Lewis Structures:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the Total Number of Valence Electrons</li>
            <li>Find the Number of Electrons Needed to Make the Atoms "Happy" (complete the octet rule)</li>
            <li>Determine the Number of Bonds in the Molecule.</li>
            <li>Choose a Central Atom.</li>
            <li>Draw a Skeletal Structure.</li>
            <li>Place Electrons Around Outside Atoms.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Formal Charge:</h5>
        <!--6. Resonance and Formal Charge-->

        <li>With Lewis Structures we like to calculate the charge of each element if they all equally shared electrons. We can calculate the formal charge of each element in a Lewis Structure in many ways:</li>
        <img src="https://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/350/Carey5th/Ch01/formalcharge00.gif" />
        <li>Smaller former charges are preferable to larger charges, however, most preferred would be that all atoms have a formal charge of 0</li>
        <li>We like to avoid like charges on adjacent atoms</li>
        <li>A more negative formal charge should be on the most electronegative atom</li>

        <h5>VSEPR and Molecular Geometry:</h5>
        <!--7. VSEPR and Bond Hybridization-->

        <li>VSEPR stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion, and when we draw Lewis Structures we only take into account the valence electrons.</li>
        <li>VSEPR says that electrons exist in pairs and these pairs repel each other to be as far apart as possible. We call these electron domains, and that's the same as the steric number. Basically just count how many things are attached to the central
            atom(s).

        <li>The longer the bond, the easier it is to break (single bonds are longer than double bond)</li>
        <li>Polar bonds are weaker than nonpolar bonds</li>
        <li>Double bonds are stronger than single bonds (pi bonds &gt; sigma bonds)</li>
