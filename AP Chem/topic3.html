    <h3>Chemical Bonds:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u><b>Ionic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, but becomes a conductor when melted or dissolved in water.</li>
        <li><u><b>Covalent Molecular:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity, as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a low melting point.</li>
        <li><u><b>Covalent Network:</b></u> A solid that doesn’t conduct electricity as a solid, liquid, or aqueous solution. They tend to have a high melting point</li>
        <li><u><b>Metallic Bonding:</b></u> A solid that is a good conductor of electricity. At the particle level, a metal consists of a crystal lattice of positive particles that consist of the nucleus and the core electrons, with a “sea” of delocalized
            valence electrons that can move freely throughout the lattice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chemical Bond Strength:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The longer the bond, the easier it is to break (single bonds are longer than double bond)</li>
        <li>Polar bonds are weaker than nonpolar bonds</li>
        <li>Double bonds are stronger than single bonds (pi bonds &gt; sigma bonds)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Alloys:</h3>
    <li>An interstitial alloy is formed between two elements in which there is a significant difference between two atomic radius of each element (steel)</li>
    <li>A substitutional alloy is formed between two elements in which the atomic radius of each element is very similar; atoms of one elements are substituted for the other (brass)</li>
