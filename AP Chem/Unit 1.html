    <h3>The Periodic Table:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Moles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Molecules can’t be counted individually because they are too small, and they move too fast, so instead we quantify them with moles, where one mole is equivalent to 6.022 &times; 10<sup>23</sup> atoms/molecules, this number is known as Avogadro's
            number, and it comes in handy for when we need to convert between measurements of substances, or stoichiometry.
        </li>
        <li>The mass of an individual unit is measured in Atomic Mass Units, or amu for short. We say that one oxygen atom is 16.00 amu whereas one mole of oxygen is 16.00 grams.</li>
        <h5>Mass Spectroscopy of Elements:</h5>

        <li>The mass spectrum of a sample containing of a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature.</li>
        <li>Simply put, we can average all the atomic masses of an element to find the real atomic weight.<br />Take Carbon for example, we have 98% C-12 and 2% C-13, so the real atomic weight would be (98%)(12) + (2%)(13), and this applies with elements
            that come in more than two masses as well.</li>
        <li>We write isotopes like this:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <element name="X" atomicNumber="Z" massNumber="A"></element>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>where X is the name of the element, Z is the atomic number (also the number of protons and the number found above the element in the periodic table of elements), and A is the atomic mass, which is protons + neutrons</li>
        <h5>Elemental Composition of Pure Substances:</h5>

        <li>Compounds are either made up of molecules or they are empirical formulas, which have the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound. An example would be
            <compound>C6H12O6</compound> (a molecular formula) versus
            <compound>CH2O</compound> (an empirical formula).</li>
        <li>To find the empirical formula, find the moles of each element in a compound, and then divide them all by the <strong>smallest</strong> number of moles. Although they may not be whole numbers, do your best to round, unless you clearly have a decimal
            like 0.5 or 0.3, in which case you would need to multiply all those values by a certain factor to get them as close to whole numbers as possible. <a id="findingEmpiricalFormulaExampleToggleLink" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleSolution('#findingEmpiricalFormulaExample', 'Example')">Show Example</a></li>
        <div id="findingEmpiricalFormulaExample" class="solution">
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">Given percents, we assume there are 100 grams of the element and then use stoichiometry accordingly.</li>

    <h3>Electron Configuration Rules:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In atoms and ions, electrons can be thought of as being in shells or energy levels. We can study the electron configuration of an atom, where the core electrons represent the inner electrons and "valence" electrons represent the outermost electrons.</li>
        <li>By Aufbau's Principle, electrons are added to lowest orbitals first. When it comes to electron configurations, you have a couple quantum numbers to look out for, <var>n</var> is the electron shell, then the letters either s, p, d, f, or g signify
            the orbital, <var>l</var> represents the angular momentum, <var>m<sub>l</sub></var> is the magnetic moment, and <var>m<sub>s</sub></var> is the spin. the following tables describe how their values range:</li>

        <li>We can draw orbital diagrams that show what electrons are where in an element. For Carbon, the orbital diagram would look something like:</li>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>2p</td>
                <td><u>&uarr;&nbsp;</u> <u>&uarr;&nbsp;</u> <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> n = 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2s</td>
                <td><u>&uarr;&darr;</u> n = 2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1s</td>
                <td><u>&uarr;&darr;</u> n = 1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>From here we can see that by Hund’s Rule, each subshell within an electron orbital should have one electron before any are doubled up. This is because electrons do not like each other due to repulsive forces.</li>

        <li>Below we can see that the wavefunctions of these electrons are in 3D space and very complex, especially because they are only probability functions on where the electron might be at any given time.</li>

        <li>The electron configuration of an element is written as follows (using Carbon as an example)
            <element name="C" fullElectronConfiguration></element>. But sometimes for elements really down the line in the periodic table of elements it gets really tedious to type it all out, so we can use what's called a Noble Gas abbreviation to arrive at the same element, just have the starting
            point be a noble gas instead of Hydrogen i.e.
            <element name="C" electronConfiguration></element>. For noble gasses themselves, we can't just say [Kr], we would need to write out
            <element name="Kr" electronConfiguration></element>
        </li>
        <li>Here's how we can find the electron configuration of any element from the periodic table of elements, simple follow the arrows from left to right, top to bottom, starting at Hydrogen:</li>

        <li>The Incoming Radiation Energy is equivalent to the Binding Energy + the Kinetic Energy of the ejected electron.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The energies of electrons in a given shell can be measured experimentally with photoelectron spectroscopy. We can see these values on a PhotoElectron Spectroscopy (PES) chart, which we can use to match up to the electron configuration and identify
            which element is in question.</li>
        <li>When we look at a PES chart, we look at it from largest binding energy to smallest (from core electrons to valence electrons). Using the height of the peaks, we can relate it to the amount of electrons in that subshell, and from there we can guess
            the element.</li>

        <li>By Coulomb's Law, we can say that the closer an electron is to the nucleus, the more strongly it is attracted. And we can also deduce that the more protons in a nucleus, the more strongly an electron is attracted.</li>
        <li>If there are electrons between a valence electron and the nucleus, the valence electrons will be less attracted to the nucleus, this is known as the Shielding effect, because the valence electrons are shielded from the pull of the nucleus.</li>
        <li>Electron shells are most stable when they are completely full.</li>
        <h5>Atomic Radius:</h5>
        <li><u><b>Decreases moving left to right</b></u> - As you go across a period, protons are added to the nucleus, so valence electrons are more strongly attracted to the nucleus, thus shrinking the size of the atom.</li>
        <li><u><b>Increases moving down a group</b></u> - As you go down a group, more electron shells are added, which adds distance to how far electrons are from the nucleus</li>
        <h5>Ionic Radius:</h5>
        <li><u><b>Cations are smaller than Anions</b></u> because as you remove an electron to form a cation, a shell is removed, and electron-electron repulsion decreases, thus making cations smaller. And as you add an electron to form an anion, electron-electron
            repulsion increases causing electrons to drift further apart, making anions bigger.</li>
        <h5>Ionization Energy:</h5>
        <li>Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron: X + IE &rarr;
            <element name="X" charge="+1"></element> +
            <element name="<var>e</var>" charge="&minus;"></element>
        </li>
        <li><b><u>Increases going left to right</u></b> - As you go across a period, protons are added to the nucleus, the electrons are more attracted to the center, requiring more energy to remove an electron</li>
        <li><b><u>Decreases going down</u></b> - As you go down a group, shells of electrons are added to the nucleus, making electrons easier to remove as they are less attracted to the center</li>
        <li>The more and more times you remove an electron, the Ionization Energy increases as a result of there being less electron-electron repulsion and being closer to the nucleus. This is the the 2nd Ionization Energy is higher than the 1st.</li>
        <li><b><u>Exceptions:</u></b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Group 16 has lower IE than group 15 (switch 15&16)</li>
            <li>Group 12 has higher IE than group 13 (switch 13&12)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Electronegativity:</h5>
        <li>Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons towards itself. F, O, N, and Cl are 4 most electronegative elements.</li>
        <li>It has the same trend as ionization energy:</li>
        <li><b><u>Increases going left to right</u></b> - The smaller an atom, the more effectively its nuclear charge will be felt past its outermost energy level, and the more likely it will be to attract other electrons</li>
        <li><b><u>Decreases going down</u></b> - The closer an element is to having a full energy level, the more likely it is to attract electrons to complete the energy level</li>
        <li><b><u>Exceptions:</u></b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Group 15 has higher electron affinity than group 16 (switch 15&14)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The equation of electronegativity is just the reverse of that in ionization energy, so technically by Hess's Law (discussed further on), the &Delta;H's would be opposite since all you do is flip the equation.</li>
    </ul>
