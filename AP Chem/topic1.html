    <h3>Moles and Molar Mass:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Molecules canâ€™t be counted individually because they are too small, and they move too fast, so instead we quantify them with moles, where one mole is equivalent to 6.022 &times; 10<sup>23</sup> atoms/molecules, this number is known as Avogadro's
            number, and it comes in handy for when we need to convert between measurements of substances, or stoichiometry.
        </li>
        <li>The mass of an individual unit is measured in Atomic Mass Units, or amu for short. We say that one oxygen atom is 16.00 amu whereas one mole of oxygen is 16.00 grams.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mass Spectroscopy of Elements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The mass spectrum of a sample containing of a single element can be used to determine the identity of the isotopes of that element and the relative abundance of each isotope in nature.</li>
        <li>Simply put, we can average all the atomic masses of an element to find the real atomic weight.<br />Take Carbon for example, we have 98% C-12 and 2% C-13, so the real atomic weight would be (98%)(12) + (2%)(13), and this applies with elements
            that come in more than two masses as well.</li>
        <li>We write isotopes like this:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <element name="X" atomicNumber="Z" massNumber="A"></element>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>where X is the name of the element, Z is the atomic number (also the number of protons and the number found above the element in the periodic table of elements), and A is the atomic mass, which is protons + neutrons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Elemental Composition of Pure Substances:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Compounds are either made up of molecules or they are empirical formulas, which have the lowest whole number ratio of atoms of the elements in a compound. An example would be
            <compound>C6H12O6</compound> (a molecular formula) versus
            <compound>CH2O</compound> (an empirical formula).</li>
        <li>To find the empirical formula, find the moles of each element in a compound, and then divide them all by the smallest number of moles. Although they may not be whole numbers, do your best to round, unless you clearly have a decimal like 0.5 or
            0.3, in which case you would need to multiply all those values by a certain factor to get them as close to whole numbers as possible. <a id="findingEmpiricalFormulaExampleToggleLink" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleSolution('#findingEmpiricalFormulaExample', 'Example')">Show Example</a></li>
        <div id="findingEmpiricalFormulaExample" class="solution">
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">Given percents, we assume there are 100 grams of the element and then use stoichiometry accordingly.</li>
