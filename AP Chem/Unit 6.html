    <h3>Heat and Temperature:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy is the capacity to do work or to produce heat. The first law of thermodynamics states that
            energy can never be created or destroyed.
        </li>
        <li>Kinetic energy of an object is the energy due to the motion of the object, given by the equation:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>\(\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2\)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat represents energy flow between two substances at different temperatures. Temperature represents the average
            amount of kinetic energy a substance has.
        </li>
        <li>In an <strong>exothermic</strong> process, energy is transferred from the system to its surroundings. In an <strong>endothermic</strong>
        process, energy is transferred from the surroundings into the process. Both physical and chemical changes can be classified as exo or enderthermic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Enthalpy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enthalpy of a substance is the measure of energy that is release or absorbed by the substance when bonds are broken and formed during a reaction.
            A change of enthalpy is equal to the energy flow as heat:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>\(\Delta H = H_{products} - H_{reactants}\)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>When the change in enthalpy is positive, heat will be absorbed by the system and it is endothermic. When it is negative, there is a generation of heat 
            and the reaction is exothermic.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Energy Diagrams:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h5>Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions:</h5>
        <img src="energydiagrams.png" alt="" />
        <li>
            The diagrams above show the energy taking place in an endothermic and exothermic reaction respectively. Reactants begin with a certain amount of energy
            and must be given energy in order to reach the highest point of the graph call the <strong>activated complex</strong>. The energy in order to get to this state
            or trigger a reaction is called the <strong>activation energy</strong> \(E_a\). All bonds have been broken and no products are formed yet. Over time, products
            will form.
        </li>
        <li>
            The energy needed to reverse a reaction is represented by \(E'_a\)
        </li>
        <li>
            The left reaction is an endothermic one because the energy of the reactants is lower than the products. Its change in enthalpy is this change of energy on the graph.
            The right reaction is exothermic since the energy of the reactants is greater than the products.
        </li>
        <h5>Catalysts:</h5>
        <li>
            Catalysts speed up reactions by providing an alternate pathway that lowers the activation energy (Imagine the a curve that is lower than the given uncatalyzed curve).
        </li>
        <li>
            A catalyst has no effect on the energy of the reactants, energy of the products, or change in enthalpy. It lowers the activation energy in both directions, so
            it has no effects on the equilibrium conditions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Enthalpy of Formation \(\Delta H^{\circ}_f\):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>standard</strong> enthalpy of formation \(\Delta H^{\circ}_f\) of a compound is defined as the change in enthalpy that accompanies
        the formation of 1 mole of a ocmpound from its elements with all substances in their standard states.</li>
        <li>
            When ever you see a <strong>degree</strong> symbol on any thermodynamic function, it indicates that the process has been carried out under standard conditions.
        </li>
        <li>Standard States:
            <ul>
                <li>Gas: pressure of 1 atm</li>
                <li>Pure substance in liquid or solid form: standard state is pure liquid or solid.</li>
                <li>Solution: concentration of exactly 1M</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enthalpy of formation is ALWAYS given per 1 mole of product: <br>
            $$\ce{C(s) + 2H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) -> CH3OH(l)} \quad \Delta H^{\circ}_f = -239 kJ/mol$$
        </li>
        <li>\(\Delta H^{\circ}_f\) for elements is defined to be 0. If \(\Delta H^{\circ}_f < 0\) for a compound, its products are more stable than its reactants.
        If \(\Delta H^{\circ}_f > 0\), the converse is true.</li>
        <li>
            The enthalpy change for a given reaction is given by:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(\Delta H^{\circ}_{reaction} = \sum n_p \Delta H^{\circ}_f \text{(products)} - \sum n_r \Delta H^{\circ}_f \text{(reactants)}\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            The terms containing n represent the moles of each molecule in the reaction. Elements are not included because they have no change in form.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combustion reactions involve hydrocarbon that is formed into carbon dioxide and water with an excess amount of oxygen as a reactant. The change in enthalpy
            is given with respect to one mole of the hydrocarbon. In order to solve one of these problems, balance the reaction and use stoichiometry to convert a given
            mass of hydrocarbon to its enthalpy of combustion with the given enthalpy of formation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bond Energy:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. Bonding is endothermic so the bond enregy is always positive.
        </li>
        <li>The change of enthalpy can be calculated using bond energies:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(\Delta H^{\circ} = \sum \text{Bond energies of bonds broken (reactants)} - \sum \text{Bond energies of bonds formed (products)}\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hess's Law:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The law states that if a reaction can be described as a series of steps, then \(\Delta H\) for the overall reaction is the sum of all the \(\Delta H\)
            values for each step.
        </li>
        <li>Three rules for manupulating equations in enthalpy calculations:
            <ol>
                <li>If you flip the reaction, flip the sign of the enthalpy value.</li>
                <li>If you multiply or divide an equation by an integer, also multiply/divide the enthalpy value by the same integer</li>
                <li>If many equations, when summed up, create a new equation, the sum of their enthalpy values will be the enthalpy value 
                    of the new equation.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Enthalpy of Solution:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When an ionic substance dissolves in water, heat is emitted or absorbed. The bond between the cation and anion breaks, requiring energy, but energy
            is also released when new attractions to water molecules forms.
        </li>
        <li>Dissolving can be separated into three steps:
            <ol>
                <li>The first first process breaks the inframolecular forces holding the solute (NaCl) together. It can be represented with
                    \(\Delta H_1 > 0\). Its endothermic:
                    $$\ce{NaCl(s) ->[energy in] Na+(g) + Cl-(g)}$$
                </li>
                <li>The next step occurs when the intermolecular forces holding the solvent (water) together break up. It can be represented with \(\Delta H_2 > 0\).
                    $$\ce{H2O(l) ->[energy in] H2O(g)}$$
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third step combines the two together. Bonds are not being formed, but energy is still released so \(\Delta H_3 < 0\).
                    $$\ce{Na+(g) + Cl-(g) + H2O(g) ->[energy out] Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq)</0>}$$
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Energy values from step 2 and 3 can be combined and that sum is called the <strong>hydration energy</strong>. That value is always negative since step 3 
            has a larger magnitude of energy than step 2. Hydration energy increases with Coulombic energy (use the formula to which ions will have a greater energy
            similar to lattice energy).
        </li>
        <li>
            The sum of all the steps, \(\Delta H_{solution} = \Delta H_1 + \Delta H_2 + \Delta H_3\), is the enthalpy of solution for that compount. If hydration energy
            exceeds the lattice energy, the enthalpy is negative. If the converse it true, then enthalpy is positive. A solution is called an <strong>ideal solution</strong>
            if \(\Delta H_{solution} = 0\), else it is a non-ideal solution.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phase Change:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h5>Naming the Phase Changes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Vapor pressure</strong> is the pressure exerted by liquid or solid molecules as they escape from the surface. When temperature increases in a substance,
                the vapor pressure will increase. When that vapor pressure becomes equal to the surroudning atmospheric pressure, the liquid boils.
            </li>
            <li>Names for phase changes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Melting - Solid to Liquid</li>
                    <li>Freeze - Liquid to Solid</li>
                    <li>Vaporization - Liquid to Gas</li>
                    <li>Condensation - Gas to Liquid</li>
                    <li>Sublimation - Solid to Gas</li>
                    <li>Deposition - Gas to Solid</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Heat of Fusion:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The heat of fusion or enthalpy of fusion is the energy required to melt a solid. It's the energy to overcome inframolecular forces holding the solid together.
                It is also the heat given off by a substance when it freezes (the sign is just flipped).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Heat of Vaporization:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Heat of vaporization or enthalpy of vaporization is the energy needed to turn a liquid into a gas. Its opposite is the heat given off by a substance when it condenses.
            </li>
            <li>As heat is added to a substance, the temperature can increase or the substance can change phases, but NOT both at the same time. So, when changing phases,
                the temperature is constant.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Calorimetry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong>heat capacity</strong>, C, of a substance is measured by:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        \(C = \dfrac{\text{heat absorbed}}{\text{increase in temperature}}\)
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat capacity is per gram, so it is important to not that the specific heat capacity is given in \(\ce{J/C\cdot g}\) or in \(\ce{J/K \cdot g}\). Moles
            can also be used instead of grams.
        </li>
        <li>
            Calorimetry is the measurement of heat changes during a chemical reaction. Under constant pressure, it can help find the enthalpy for that reaction.
            Heat of a reaction can be determined by the following equation:
            <table class="rules">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        q = mc\Delta T
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            \(q\) = heat added 
            \(m\) = mass of the substance 
            \(c\) = specific heat 
            \(\Delta T\) = change in temperature 
        </li>
        <li>
            Using stoichiometry, you can find the moles of product formed. Dividing q by that will yield the change in enthalpy of the reaction.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heating Curves:</h3>
    <ul>
        <img src="heatingcurve.jpeg" alt="" width="50%"/>
        <li>
            A heating curve shows what happens to the temperature of a substance as heat is added. The amount of the temperature increase is found through
            calorimetry. If the substance is in the process of a phase change, temperature is constant. The amount of heat needed to go through this phase is
            found through the heat of fusion or vaporization.
        </li>
    </ul>
