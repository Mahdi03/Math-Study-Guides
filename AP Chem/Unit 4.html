    <h3>Types Of Reactions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <!--Add other types of chemical reactions here-->
        <h5>Precipitation Reactions:</h5>
        <li>Precipitation reactions involve the combination of two different ionic compounds in aqueous solutions to form another soluble compound.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chemical Equations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h5>Net Ionic Equations:</h5>
        <!--Get more detailed about them here-->
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gravimetric Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Acids and Bases:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Acids are proton donors (
            <element name="H" charge="&plus;"></element>) and cations are positive ions.</li>
        <li>Bases are proton acceptors(
            <element name="OH" charge="&minus;"></element>) and anions are negative ions.</li>
        <li>
            <compound>H2O</compound> is a nonelectrolyte so
            <element name="H" charge="&plus;"></element> and
            <element name="OH" charge="&minus;"></element> can't coexist, they must come together to form water. This is why you'll see that in acid-base reactions,
            <compound>H2O</compound> is a product.
        </li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <compound state="aq">H^+</compound> +
                    <compound state="aq">OH^-</compound> &rarr;
                    <compound state="l">H2O</compound>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>The above chemical equation is also the Net Ionic equation of
            <compound state="aq">HCl</compound> +
            <compound state="aq">NaOH</compound> &rarr;
            <compound state="l">H2O</compound> +
            <compound state="aq">NaCl</compound>
        </li>
        <li>However, water is not always a product in acid-base reactions. An ionic compound always is, though.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Abbreviated as redox reactions, these reactions involve the transfer of electrons.</li>
        <h5>Oxidation States:</h5>
        <li>In these kinds of reactions we assign "oxidation states" that are numbers to keep track of how many electrons are in each element in chemical compounds</li>
        <li>One important difference to note is that oxidation numbers are NOT the same as charges, with charges we would write
            <element name="O" charge="2&minus;"></element> but with oxidation states we would write
            <element name="O" oxidationState="&minus;2"></element>
        </li>
        <li>With a covalent bond between two identical atoms, we split the number in half</li>
        <li>In compounds where electrons are unequally shared, all the electrons go towards the more electronegative atom, so in
            <compound>H2O</compound>, O will have an excess 2 electrons and H each will have no electrons. So </li>
        <li>For covalent compounds, these numbers represent the would-be charges, whereas for the ionic compounds, these ARE the charges.</li>

        <h5>Balancing Redox Reactions:</h5>
        <li>In these kinds of reactions, we can check to see if it is a redox reaction by looking at oxidation states and seeing electrons being gained or lost from one side of the equation to the other.</li>
        <li>In a redox reaction, the total electrons gained and lost must be equal.</li>
        <li>In order to balance a reaction using Oxidation-Reduction:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Split up the equation based on elements and their oxidation states</li>
            <li>Isolate the elements that change oxidation and equalize electrons gained/lost&mdash;add these coefficients only to the oxidizing and reducing agents</li>
            <li>Balance the rest of the equation normally and add states of matter</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
