    <h3>Endothermic and Exothermic Processes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <h5>Endothermic:</h5>
        <li>
            In Endothermic Reactions, energy (in the form of heat) is transferred from the surroundings into the system
        </li>
        <li>The reaction feels cold to the touch, and the thermometer will pick up a decrease in temperature; so heat is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Liquid to Gas and Solid to Liquid phase changes are all endothermic processes.</li>
        <li>Products are at a higher energy level than the reactants</li>
        <h5>Exothermic:</h5>
        <li>In Exothermic Reactions, energy (in the form of heat) is transferred from the system out to its surroundings</li>
        <li>The reaction feels warm to the touch, and the thermometer will pick up an increase in temperature; so heat is released.</li>
        <li>Products are at a lower energy level than the reactants</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Energy, Enthalpy, and Heat:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy is the capacity to do work or transfer heat</li>
        <li>Whenever there is an energy difference, heat will transfer from the hotter areas to the colder areas, this is given by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics</li>
        <li>Enthalpy is used to measure changes in energy for a constant pressure system</li>
        <li>If &delta;H is positive, it's an endothermic process</li>
        <li>If &delta;H is negative, it's an exothermic process</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heat Transfer and Thermal Equilibrium:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This heat transfer occurs until the two items or mediums have reached a thermal equilibrium, remember that in thermal equilibrium there is the most randomness in the assortment of particles, this is also known as <u>entropy</u>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heat Capacity and Calorimetry:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Specific Heat is the amount of energy required to raise temperature of one gram of a substance by 1&deg;C</li>
        <li>There is an inverse relationship between value of c and change in temperature
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Energy of Phase Changes:</h3>
    <li>When temperature increases, phase changes wonâ€™t occur, phase change is occurring when temperature is constant</li>
    <li>The steeper the curve, the lower the specific heat (less heat energy required to increase the temperature)</li>
    <li>It takes more energy to boil liquid to a gas, because all the IMF's are being broken, whereas melting a solid only breaks some of the IMF's.</li>

    <li>Breaking bonds is an endothermic process and forming bonds is an exothermic process. We say that the energy required to break bonds is bond enthalpy.</li>
    <li>The standard enthalpy of formation represents the change in enthalpy associated with the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements under standard conditions.</li>
