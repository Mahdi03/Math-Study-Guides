            <li>A titration is an experiment that can be used to calculate the amount of moles or the concentration of one chemical by reacting it with a known quantity of another chemical.</li>
            <li>The standard solution of known concentration is known as the titrant and the solution of unknown concentration is known as the analyte.</li>
            <li>The titrant is added slowly to the analyte by using a buret which drops it into a flask.</li>
            <li>The equivalence point in a titration is the point at which just enough titrant has been added to react with all of the analyte. This point may be indicated by a color change in the flask.</li>
