    <h3>Polarity of Molecules:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Molecules are nonpolar when all of the bond dipoles within the molecule cancel each other out</li>
        <li>Molecular are considered polar when all of the bond dipoles within the molecule do NOT cancel each other out</li>
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NonPolarPolar.png" />
        <li>One way to see if a molecule is polar is to see if you can easily separate all the different types with one line. If so, then it is polar, but if everything is evenly distributed, then it must be nonpolar. Pay attention to the partial charges
            denoted by &delta;+ and &delta;&minus;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Intermolecular Forces:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>InterMolecular Forces (abbreviated IMF's) are the forces that hold together other molecules, and they are considered pretty weak in comparison to Intramolecular Forces, which are the forces that hold the atoms together within a single molecule.</li>
        <li><u>London Dispersion Forces</u> are the forces formed when nonpolar molecules are polarized by other nonpolar molecules temporarily, distorting the electron clouds in the right manner causing an even weaker force of attraction. We say that the
            more electrons these molecules have, with more ease can they be polarized, creating stronger London Dispersion Forces.</li>
        <li><u>Dipole-Dipole Forces</u> are forces that hold polar molecules together, unlike the London Dispersion Forces. The attraction happens between a partially positive end of one molecule, and a partially negative end of another.</li>
        <li>With <u>Dipole-Induced Dipole Forces</u>, this is when a polar molecule temporarily polarizes a non-polar molecule and there is an attraction caused between them.</li>
        <li><u>Hydrogen Bonding Attractions</u> are strong dipole-dipole interactions, which occur between an H atom on one molecule and a N, O, or F on another molecule.</li>
        <li><u>Ion-Dipole Forces</u> are attractive force between ions and polar molecules.</li>
        <li>Here is a diagram showing off all the types of IMF's (ranked from strongest to weakest):</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>States of Matter:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Solids</u> are when particles are close to each other, and the motion of the particles is limited to vibration within the crystal structure.</li>
        <li><u>Liquids</u> are when particles are close to each other and constantly moving and colliding. Properties of the liquids are relative to the strength of IMF's.</li>
        <li><u>Gases</u> have no definite volume or shape since their particles are very far apart from each other and are constantly moving/colliding. They posses minimal to no IMF's.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Properties of Liquids and Solids:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vapor Pressure is the pressure exerted by a gas in equilibrium with its liquid phase at a given temperature. Temperature and vapor pressure are proportional.</li>
        <li>At the same temperature, stronger IMF's mean that molecules are less likely to break their IMF's and escape to form a gas, therefore, higher IMF's means lower vapor pressures.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of Solids:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><u>Ionic Solids:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These have relatively high melting and boiling points</li>
                <li>They only conduct electricity when melted or aqueous because of mobile ions</li>
                <!--FIX-->
                li{Brittle solid because of repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer}
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Metallic Solids:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These are great conductors of electricity because a metal consists of a crystal lattice of positive particles that consist of the nucleus and core electrons, with a “sea” of delocalized electrons that move freely throughout the lattice.</li>
                <li>They are also ductile and malleable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Covalent Network:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>This is when atoms are covalently bonded in a 3D network</li>
                <li>They are built-up of Many strong covalent bonds, which is why they are very hard and have high melting points. Some examples include Diamonds or
                    <compound>SiO2</compound>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><u>Covalent Molecular:</u></b>
            <ul>
                <li>These are composed of distinct, individual molecules that are attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces.</li>
                <li>They have relatively low melting points because of weak IMF's.</li>
                <li>They cannot conduct electricity because valence electrons are held tightly within the covalent bonds of each molecule.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
