    <h3>Equilibrium in Reversible Reactions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In this unit, the focus is reversible reactions, reactions with low enough energy differences such that they can work both forwards and backwards.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Equilibrium Constant:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Equilibrium occurs when in a reversible reaction, the rate of reactants becoming products is equivalent to the rate of products becoming reactants. However, just because the rates are the same, does NOT mean the concentrations are the same.</li>
        <li>For a reaction {aA + bB &rlhar; cC + dD}, the equilibrium constant is given by:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <equation>
                        k<sub>eq</sub> =
                        <div class="fraction">
                            <div class="top">[C]<sup>c</sup>[D]<sup>d</sup></div>
                            <div class="bottom">[A]<sup>a</sup>[B]<sup>b</sup></div>
                        </div>
                    </equation>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>If
            <equation>k<sub>eq</sub> &lt; 1</equation>, the reaction favors the backwards direction since there is a higher concentration of reactants.</li>
        <li>If
            <equation>k<sub>eq</sub> &gt; 1</equation>, the reaction favors the forwards direction since there is a higher concentration of products.</li>
        <li>Reversible reactions at equilibrium with different states of matter are said to be in <u>Heterogeneous Equilibrium</u>. In these cases we ignore the solvents and the solids because they are in excess, so it makes sense to not take into account
            such high concentrations into our formula for the equilibrium constant.</li>
        <li>In equilibrium reactions, pay attention to the state of matter. <strong style="color:mediumvioletred;">Concentrations of solids and liquids are omitted from all calculations</strong>. Another way to think of this is that liquids and solids don't have concentrations to begin with, there is no such thing as stronger water.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Le Ch&acirc;telier's Principle:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Simply put, Le Ch&acirc;telier's Principle tells us that when we "stress" out one side of a reversible reaction, the reaction will favor reaching equilibrium by going in the direction of the other side.</li>
        <li>If we add more of one reactant, there is a higher probability of it colliding with other reactants, so other reactants would be used up more, and the forward reaction rate increases. When that happens, more products are created, and a new equilibrium
            will be reached, favoring the forward direction.</li>
        <li>When the pressure is increased, the molecules are closer together, and have a higher probability of colliding. When pressure increases, the reaction favors the side with less molecules because it is easier to compress fewer molecules (think PV
            = nRT, as pressure goes up, moles goes down to keep it the same).</li>

    </ul>
    <h5>Changes In The Equilibrium Constant:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Reaction Quotient:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The reaction quotient is the same thing as the equilibrium constant, except the usage varies. While k<sub>c</sub> gives us information when the reaction is at equilibrium, Q<sub>c</sub> can be calculated at any time.</li>

    <h3>Solubility:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you dissolve salt into water, you are putting the <u>solute</u>
            <compound state="s">NaCl</compound> into the <u>solvent</u>
            <compound state="l">H2O</compound> through the process of <u>hydration</u>.</li>
        <li>The water molecules are able to pull apart the ionic bond and create
            <compound>Na^+</compound> and
            <compound>Cl^-</compound> ions because water molecules are polar dipoles. They attract the ions and surround them in the form of an ion-dipole interaction.</li>
        <li>This process is also known as <u>dissolution</u>, when a solid is made into a solution. The opposite of this would be <u>precipitation</u>, where ions in a solution form a solid.</li>
        <li>For weak acids/bases and other slightly soluble molecules, we like to measure just how much is actually dissolved. We can measure the solubility based on how many grams are dissolved per liter. We can also convert this to Molars (mol/L) for easier
            use with our other equations.</li>
        <li>We represent the dissolution of weak acids/bases and other slightly soluble molecules with reversible reactions, so naturally, they will reach an equilibrium when that certain amount dissolves. We can solve for an equilibrium constant for the
            solubility reaction K<sub>sp</sub>, we call this the <u>solubility product constant</u>.</li>
        <li>We can find K<sub>sp</sub> by setting up an ICE table, and allowing our found solubility molar to be the change in the reactant's molarity. From there, and assuming the reaction has just started, we can fill in the rest of the table to solve for
            K
            <sub>sp</sub>. Since we don't take into account solids in equilibrium reactions, we only need the concentrations of the products. For a reaction<br />

            <compound state="aq">xM<sup>x</sup>^+</compound> +

            <compound state="aq">KCl</compound>, since there are already
            <compound>Cl^-</compound> ions in the solution, less of the
            <compound state="s">PbCl2</compound> will dissolve into the solution. We can back this up with Le Ch&acirc;telier's Principle, since we are adding more "stress" to the products side with the extra
            <compound>Cl^-</compound>, the reversible solubility reaction for
            <compound state="s">PbCl2</compound> will shift more towards the reactants, thus having a lower molar solubility in
            <compound state="aq">KCl</compound> as opposed to just pure water.</li>
        <li>We can use the common-ion effect to separate out a solid that is slightly soluble. By adding in more of a common-ion, we can make more of the solid by stressing the products side of the reversible solubility reaction.</li>
