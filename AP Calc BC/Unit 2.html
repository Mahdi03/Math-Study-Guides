      <strong><h5>Extreme Value Theorem or "EVT":</h5></strong>
      <li>If a function <var>f</var> is continuous on the closed interval [<var>a, b</var>], then <var>f</var> must have an absolute minimum and maximum value at least once.</li>
      <li>If a function <var>f</var> is continuous on the open interval [<var>a, b</var>], then <var>f</var> may have a local minimum and/or maximum value.</li>
      <li>In order to find the minimum or maximum of a graph, take the derivative and solve for <var>x</var> when the derivative is either equal to 0 or undefined.</li>
      <li>The reason this works is because when the function switches from increasing to decreasing and vice-versa, the function either curves, corners, or cusps. And the slope of the tangent line at the middle of these switches is either 0 or undefined.</li>
      <li>Whenever the derivative is equal to 0 or undefined, those values for <var>x</var> are called critical points.</li>
      <li>Once you have the critical points, plug them back into the original <var>f</var>, as well as the endpoints if the function is on a closed interval. Then rank the minimum and maximum of those values. If any of these values is also undefined, then it is not a critical point.</li>

      <h5>The First Derivative Test:</h5>
      <li>Determine the sign of the derivative of <var>f</var> to the left and right of the critical value</li>
