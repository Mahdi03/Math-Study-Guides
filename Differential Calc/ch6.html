        <h3>6.1: Cauchy-Euler Equations:</h3>
        <li>So far we have only focused on differential equations with constant coefficients, but now it's time to focus on non-constant coefficients. Cauchy-Euler Equations are differential equations of the form:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <var>a</var><sub><var>n</var></sub><var>x</var><sup><var>n</var></sup>
                    <derivative of="y" respectTo="x" order="<var>n</var>"></derivative>
                    + <var>a</var><sub><var>n</var> &minus; 1</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>n</var> &minus; 1</sup>
                    <derivative of="y" respectTo="x" order="<var>n</var> &minus; 1"></derivative>
                    + ... + <var>a</var><sub>1</sub><var>x</var>
                    <derivative of="y" respectTo="x" order=""></derivative> + <var>a</var><sub>0</sub><var>y</var> = 0
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>We can suspect the solutions to be of the form <var>y = x<sup>n</sup></var>, and by plugging it in to the equation, we start to see that when the substituted equation has <var>n</var> distinct roots, the general solution is:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <var>y</var>(<var>x</var>) = <var>c</var><sub>1</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>m</var><sub>1</sub></sup> + <var>c</var><sub>2</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>m</var><sub>2</sub></sup> + ... + <var>c</var><sub><var>n</var></sub><var>x</var><sup><var>m<sub>n</sub></var></sup>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>When we have repeating roots, we multiply subsequent terms by another
            <ln>x</ln>. The set of solutions for a root of multiplicity <var>k</var> is:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    {<var>x</var>, <var>x</var>
                    <ln><var>x</var></ln>, <var>x</var>[
                    <ln><var>x</var></ln>]<sup>2</sup>, ..., <var>x</var>[
                    <ln>x</ln>]<sup><var>k</var> &minus; 1</sup>}
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>When we have complex roots, we solve for the roots <var>m</var>, put them back into <var>y = e<sup>m</sup></var>, and then using Euler's Identity (<var>e<sup>i&theta;</sup> = </var>
            <cos>&theta;</cos> + <var>i</var>
            <sin>&theta;</sin>) and the Superposition Principle to make our answer real. When the root is <var>m</var> = <var>a &plusmn; bi</var>, the general solution will be:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>

                    <var>y</var>(<var>x</var>) = <var>c</var><sub>1</sub><var>x</var><sup><var>a</var></sup>
                    <cos><var>b</var>

        <h3>6.2: Power Series Solutions to Differential Equations:</h3>
        <li>When we have Cauchy-Euler Differential Equations with polynomial coefficients, we assume the solution would be a polynomial of unknown degree. We can represent that polynomial in the form of a power series.</li>
        <li>We assume the polynomial to be the form of:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <equation>
                        <sigma start="<var>n</var> = 0" end="&infin;"></sigma>
                        <var>c<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup></var>
                    </equation>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>In order to test a power series solution, we write the probable power series solution in summation notation and substitute back into the equation.</li>
        <li>When we differentiate a summation, the index increases by one to account for the lost term.</li>
        <li>When the index changes, we need to equalize the indexes at some other variable so that we can manipulate the multiple summations.</li>
        <li>Once you find a power series solution, don't forget to find the interval of convergence. Recall the Ratio Test from <a href="../AP Calc BC/studyGuide.html">Unit 4</a> in the AP Calculus BC Study Guide.</li>
        <h3>6.3: Solutions About Ordinary Points:</h3>
        <li>After normalizing a differential equation with polynomial coefficients, we get an equation of the form:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <equation><var>y'' + P(x)y' + Q(x)y = 0</var></equation>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>In this scenario, <var>P(x)</var> and <var>Q(x)</var> need to be able to expressed in the form of a power series. We say these equations are <u>analytic</u> at their centers
            <equation><var>x = x<sub>c</sub></var></equation>.</li>
        <li>For the differential equation, we say the center to those functions <var>P(x)</var> and <var>Q(x)</var> is considered an <u>ordinary point</u>.</li>
        <li>Be aware that while most power series we encounter in summation notation can be written as a function, sometimes they just don't have recognizable function.</li>
        <h3>6.4</h3>
        <li>If either or both <var>P(x)</var> and <var>Q(x)</var> are not analytic at <var>x =</var> 0, then <var>x =</var> 0 is a singular point.</li>
        <li>If <var>xP(x)</var> and <var>x</var><sup>2</sup><var>Q(x)</var> are both analytic at <var>x =</var> 0, we can say that <var>x =</var> 0 is a <u>regular singular point</u>. If not, then it is an <u>irregular singular point</u>.</li>
        <li>When <var>x =</var> 0 is a regular singular point, our solution is in the form:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <equation>
                        <sigma start="n = 0" end="&infin;"></sigma>
                        <var>c<sub>n</sub>(x &minus; x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>n + r</sup></var>
                    </equation>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>In the equation above, we need to solve for our value <var>r</var>. Since we must solve for <var>r</var>, it is not guaranteed that <var>r</var> will be a pleasant number, and for this reason we cannot say that the formula above is a power series
            (since <var>r</var> would need to be a positive whole number).</li>
        <li>Another thing to note is that when we differentiate the above equation, we must keep the index the same, unlike regular differentiation in summation notation.</li>
