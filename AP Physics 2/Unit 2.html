        <h3>Thermodynamics:</h3>
        <li>This is the study of the motion of heat, but heat is just another form of energy, so essentially it's just the study of how energy moves through matter</li>
        <li>In this unit, matter is going to be made up of a lot of tiny particles that are constantly bumping and colliding into each other</li>
        <li>In ideal gasses, these particle collisions are held to be elastic, meaning that no energy is lost within the collisions</li>
        <h5>Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution:</h5>
        <!--Insert image of graph-->
        <li>This is a graph that gives the # of particles each with a certain amount of kinetic energy</li>
        <li>Remember that the Average Kinetic Energy of the particles is directly related to the temperature</li>
        <li>If you know the mass of the particles, you can find the velocity distribution of the same particles from this Kinetic Energy distribution</li>
        <li>This direct relationship is given by the equation (where T is temperature is in kelvin):</li>

        <li>Whenever there is an energy difference, heat will transfer from the hotter areas to the colder areas, this is given by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics</li>
        <li>This heat transfer occurs until the two items or mediums have reached a thermal equilibrium, remember that in thermal equilibrium there is the most randomness in the assortment of particles, this is also known as ____________</li>
        <li>There are three types of heat transfer:</li>
        <ol>
            <!--Insert image of all three types of heat transfer-->
            <li>
                <b><u>Conduction</u></b> - heat transfer through physical conduct, this happens when particles of a hotter substance transfer their mechanical energy to particles of a colder substance through collisions where momentum is conserved, and
                with higher temperatures, an object's particles are moving faster.<br />
                <!--Insert image of conduction--><br /> The equation for conduction is given by

                Where <var>Q</var> is the energy in Joules being transferred over a change in time (<var>&Delta;t</var>), <var>k</var> is a constant called the <u>thermal conductivity</u> of an object, <var>A</var> is the cross-sectional area through
                which contact is being made, <var>&Delta;T</var> is the temperature difference between the two surfaces, and <var>L</var> is the perpendicular of the connector object in between the temperatures
            </li>
            <li><b><u>Convection</u></b> - heat transfer through a fluid (remember that air is also a fluid!), warmer fluids are less dense than colder fluids so they rise and the colder fluids sink (remember "hot air rises" from hurricanes)</li>
            <li><b><u>Radiation</u></b> - heat transfer through electromagnetic waves being emitted or absorbed (in fact, everything emits some sort of radiation based on its temperature, and they absorb radiation based on their albedo)</li>
