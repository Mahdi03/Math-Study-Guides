    <ul>
        <li>A basic electric circuit is comprised of a source of power, something that requires power, and a complete connection for the flow of electrons. For our purposes, we will use batteries, wall outlets, and capacitors (later in this unit) as sources
            of power. Things like resistors will take up some of that power and we use wires to complete a full path for electricity.</li>
        <li>Circuits have a couple basic quantities:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><u><b>Current</b></u> - The amount of charge flowing over time (flow rate when it comes to electricity). Its units are Amps (A), short for Amperes, which is really just Coulombs per second (C/s). The formula matches exactly that:
                <table class="rules">
                    <tr>
                        <td><var>I = <div class="fraction"><div class="top">&Delta;Q</div><div class="bottom">&Delta;t</div></div></var></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li><u><b>Resistance</b></u> - How much the component restricts the flow of current. The resistance (<var>R</var>) of a resistor depends on length (<var>l</var>) and cross-sectional area (<var>A</var>), as well as a property unique to different
                elements known as the resistivity (&rho;). Its units are in Ohms (&Omega;) as explained by Ohm's Law. The relation is as follows:
                <table class="rules">
                    <tr>
                        <td><var>R = &rho; <div class="fraction"><div class="top">l</div><div class="bottom">A</div></div></var></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                The reason why is because the resistance is directly proportional to the length, as length increases, the more current is restricted, and resistance is indirectly proportional to the cross-sectional area, as the cross-sectional area increases, the resistance
                goes down since there is less constriction of the current, it can flow more freely.<br />

            </li>
            <li><u><b>Voltage</b></u> - The change in Electric Potential Energy between two locations. Again, its units are in Volts (V). Voltage is related to Current (<var>I</var>) and Resistance (<var>R</var>) through Ohm's Law:
                <table class="rules">
                    <tr>
                        <td><var>V = IR</var></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li><u><b>Power</b></u> - The rate at which energy being used up. Its units are in Watts (W), which is really just Joules per second (J/s). There are a couple mathematical definitions of power, including the basic definition, its relation to circuits,
                and how rearranging/substituting Ohm's Law helps us find other values:
                <table class="rules">

                        <td><var>P = <div class="fraction"><div class="top">&Delta;E</div><div class="bottom">&Delta;t</div></div></var></td>
                        <td><var>P = I&Delta;V</var></td>

        <li>A resistor is a circuit component uses up electrical energy, they are usually lights or other appliances, but resistors can also come in the form of just plain resistors that have no function other than to slow down the current in the circuit.</li>
        <li>In a circuit diagram, we draw resistors like so:</li>
        <canvas id="resistorDrawingCanvas" width="40" height="20"></canvas>
        <script class="renderJS">
            var resistorDrawingCanvas = document.querySelector("#resistorDrawingCanvas");
            var resistorDrawingCircuitDiagram = new CircuitDiagram(resistorDrawingCanvas);
            resistorDrawingCircuitDiagram.beginCircuit(5, 10).drawResistor();
            resistorDrawingCircuitDiagram.ctx.stroke();

        <li>Capacitors are another type of component used in circuits. Like resistors, and really any circuit component, they can be placed in series or parallel. Unlike resistors, the capacitor has no resistive abilities. Instead, it is capable of storing
            up charge from a power source.</li>

        <li>Capacitors are two conducting plates that are separated from one another by a material. This separating material is called the dielectric.</li>
        <li>The way capacitors work is that the current starts accumulating charge on one plate, but it has no way to pass through the capacitor to the other end and complete a circuit. However, when enough charge accumulates on one plate, it induces a charge
            of opposite sign on the other plate, thus completing the circuit.</li>
        <li>There is one very positively charged plate, and one very negatively charged plate, when the capacitor is charged. This causes an Electric Field between the plates, and you can solve for that electric field through:

        <li>Capacitors can only hold so much charge, though, because at one point, so much charge will accumulate that it will start to push the current backwards and the current will stop flowing. When the capacitor is fully charged, current no longer flows.</li>
        <li>The capacitance of a capacitor&mdash;in Farads (F)&mdash; tells us how well a capacitor can store charge, and it is defined to be:

            vacuum of permittivity, it is a constant on the equation sheet, &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> = 8.85 &times; 10<sup>&minus;12</sup>

        <li>The reason why resistors are more effective in series is because when they are in parallel, the current has more options on where it can go through.</li>
        <li>The reason why capacitors are more ineffective in series is due to their charging nature, they require the current to flow around them as they "bridge the gap", so capacitors in parallel have a better ability to induce current from the other side
            as opposed to multiple capacitors in series.</li>
    </ul>
