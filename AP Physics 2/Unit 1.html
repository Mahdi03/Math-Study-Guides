    <h3>Special Relativity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed is relative, only the speed of light remains constant.</li>
        <li>Time is also relative to the observer (moving clocks run slower). This effect is known as <u>Time Dilation</u>.</li>
        <li>The following equation find the factor by which to dilate time or length, using the velocity and the speed of light:</li>

        </table>
        <li>Typically we assume that the observer is always at rest and everything else around them is what moves.</li>
        <li>When objects move fast relative to the speed of light, lengths get shorter in the dierction of movement (meaning that it moves horizontally but vertical length stays the same). This is known as <u>length contraction</u></li>
        <li>In any situation, two different observers will always agree on their relative speeds to each other and the absolute speed of light.</li>
        <li>In AP Physics 1 we learned <var>p = mv</var>, but when we reach relativistic speeds (speeds closer to the speed of light <var>c</var>) we need to correct this formula to:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td><var>p = &gamma;mv</var></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h5>Law of Conservation of Mass-Energy:</h5>
        <li>Einstein figured out that mass was just highly compressed energy, and formed the correct relation between energy, mass and speed</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>

        <li>When <var>v</var> = 0, or when the object is at rest, the formula boils down to a more familiar <var>E = mc</var><sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>At really low speeds we can use Newtonian Mechanics to approximate the energy of an object to be <var>E = mc</var><sup>2</sup> +

        <li>Using the above formula we can find how much energy is released in nuclear reactions in the form of mass lost.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General Relativity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Acceleration is accompanied by forces, the observer that is accelerating feels the time dilation and the length contraction.</li>
        <li>While Special Relativity deals with differences in velocities, it's all inertial. General Relativity deals with acceleration.</li>
        <li>Accelerating feels like an external gravitational field, and all physics falls under this equivalence principle.</li>
        <li>If you accelerate at a relativistic rate, a light beam will curve as if it were undergoing projectile motion. Therefore we can deduce that gravtiy makes light curve (this effect is known as <u>Gravitational Lensing</u>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Light Models:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Light is just one form of electromagnetic radiation.</li>
        <li>Light can be modeled in three ways:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>The ray model: a laser beam</li>
            <li>The wave model: ripples</li>
            <li>The particle model: collisions with other particles</li>
        </ol>
        <li>The ray model and the particle model are both linear types of models, and the intricacy of quantum relativity allows for all three models to hold true in certain situations.</li>
        <li>The difference between mechanical or sound waves and electromagnetic radiation is that sound waves require a medium to travel through whereas electromagnetic radiation can travel through vacuums. Electromagnetic waves fo throuhg an electromagnetic
            field so they can travel with or without matter present.</li>
        <h5>Diffraction:</h5>
        <li>Sound also travels outwards in waves</li>
        <li>When light is shone through a small slit, a pattern is formed from overlapping waves. This is explained by Huygen's Principle, and it occurs best when the slit matches the wavelength of the wave:</li>

        <ul>
            <li> When the waves are perfectly in-sync (said to be in phase), they will add up. When the waves add together, it is <u>constructive interference</u></li>
            <!--Image of constructive interference-->
            <img src="images/Unit 1/constructiveInterference.png" alt="Image of constructive interference" />
            <li>When the waves are off each other by half a wavelength (said to be out of phase), they will cancel each other out. When the waves cancel each other out, it is <u>destructive interference</u></li>

<h5>The Photoelectric Effect:</h5>

<!--Show graph of # of electrons/sec over fequency of light cathode w/ threshold frequency graph-->

<li>As the wavelength decreases (&darr;), the energy increases (&uarr;) as the electrons shoot further</li>
<li>As the intensity increases (&uarr;), the number of electrons increases (&uarr;)</li>
<li>In this scenario, light is modeled as particles (photons). In this way, energy is transferred immediately through collision.</li>
<li>The energy of a photon can be given by:
    <table class="rules">
        <tr>
            <td><var>E = hf</var></td>
        </tr>
    </table>where <var>h</var> is Planck's constant (depending on whether you are working with electron-volts (eV) or Joules (J))</li>
<li>Using the formula:

    <table class="rules">
        <tr>
            <td>KE<sub>max</sub> = <var>hf &minus; &phi;</var></td>
            <th style="font-weight: normal;"></th>
        </tr>
    </table> where <var>f</var> is the frequency and &phi; is the minimum energy required to emit an electron, we can find out if there is enough energy within a light photon to exhibit the photoelectric effect, given an original "threshold energy" that tells
    us the minimum energy required to exhibit the photoelectric effect.
</li>
<li>The wavelength needs to be large enough to not pass through the atom (like how gamma rays pass through metals between the atoms and don't eject electrons) to exhibit the photoelectric effect.</li>
<li>Electrons interact with crystalline salts to create interference patterns, therefore electrons behave like waves as well!</li>
<li>While the following formula works well with photons, it helps us find the wavelength of ANY particle (where <var>p</var> is the momentum of the photon or particle) { return this.; }}):
</li>
<table class="rules">
    <tr>
        <td><var>&lambda; = <div class="fraction"><div class="top">h</div><div class="bottom">p</div></div></var></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<li>So then if everything has wave-like behaviors, how come we can't see those waves in action with every day objects? Only high enough wavelengths exhibit wave-like properties, and the smaller the mass, the lower the speed. The lower the speed, the higher
    the wavelength which means we would see wave-like behaviors with only items of really small mass.</li>
<h3>Quantum Mechanics:</h3>
<h5>Wavefunction Collapse:</h5>
<li>A particle is in a completely random place in all its places within its wavefunction until a measurement is made or a collision occurs. Then it randomly chooses a place according to its probability wavefunction.</li>
<li>Just some relationships to keep in mind:<br /> A smaller wavelength = high energy = high momentum, a larger wavelength = low energy = low momentum<br /> (&lambda;&darr; = E&uarr; = <var>p</var>&uarr;) and (&lambda;&uarr; = E&darr; = <var>p</var>&darr;)
</li>
<li>Exact position and exact speed/momentum are unknown at the same time, this is also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The more you know about one, the more inaccurate you are about the other. Schrodinger's Cat is an example</li>
<h5>Electronic Structure:</h5>
<li>Bohr's model shows discrete electron levels that show the absorption and emission of energy. This modle works with simple atoms and some simple compounds.</li>
<!--Insert image of absorption/emission in Bohr's model-->
<img src="images/Unit 1/bohrsModel.png" alt="Bohr's Model" />
<li>However, the model doesn't explain why compounds like Graphite can conduct electrons, that's where the wavefunction of electrons comes in handy.</li>
<!--Show diagram of electron wave functions interference and discrete levels-->
<img src="images/Unit 1/bohrsModelWavefunction.png" />
<li>There are three types of electron movement in an atom:</li>
<ol>
    <li><u><b>Spontaneous absorption:</b></u> - electron jumps to a higher energy state<br />
        <!--Add image of Spontaneous absorption-->
        <img src="images/Unit 1/spontaneousAbsorption.png" />
    </li>
    <li><u><b>Spontaneous emission:</b></u> - electron falls to a lower energy state<br />
        <!--Add image of Spontaneous emission-->
        <img src="images/Unit 1/spontaneousEmission.png" />
    </li>
    <li><u><b>Stimulated emission:</b></u> - electron falls to a lower energy state only when a photon of same energy stimulates the change.<br />
        <!--Add image of Stimulated emission-->
        <img src="images/Unit 1/stimulatedEmission.png" /><br /> Both photons (incoming and outgoing) are in the same direction, in phase, and have the same polarization. This stimulation occurs through:

<h3>The Fundamentals:</h3>
<li>Matter is made up of:</li>
<ol>
    <li>
        Leptons - electrons, positrons, muons, neutrinos
    </li>
    <li>
        Carrier particles that each carry cation forces - photons, gluons, higgs bosons
    </li>
    <li>
        Quarks that combine to make protons and neutrons<br />

    </li>
</ol>
<h5>The 4 Fundamental Forces:</h5>
<li>We would assume gravity is a fundamental force but in reality it is actually a part of the following force</li>
<ol>
    <li><u><b>Electromagnetism</b></u> - Attraction and repulsion based on charge, it's the force that allows you to push objects and stand, it's the microscopic repulsion.</li>
    <li><u><b>Strong nuclear force</b></u> - The force that holds protons and neutrons together</li>
    <li><u><b>Weak nuclear force</b></u> = Allows quarks to change their "flavor", allows protons &rarr; neutrons and vice versa</li>
</ol>
<li>In a nucleus, you have all three forces working together and against each other, it's really chaotic since the protons are pushing away from each other but the strong force holds them together</li>
<li>When a nucleus is formed, they emit a binding energy which results in a mass defect, meaning that the before products have a higher mass than the final products. Using Eintein's Mass-Energy formula with the mass difference, we can calculate how much binding
    energy was released from a nuclear equation and a Periodic Table of Elements.</li>
<li>There are three types of radioactive decay:</li>
<ol>
    <li><u><b>Alpha decay (&alpha;)</b></u> - When the nucleus is too large (too much mass), the proton-proton repulsion (Coulomb Force) becomes greater than the Strong Force and pushes a proton out. Because the strong force holds protons and neutrons together,
        a neutron is lost as well, causing the overall loss of an Alpha particle (
        <element atomicNumber="2" massNumber="4" name="&alpha;"></element>), or the same as an atom of Helium (
        <element name="He" massNumber atomicNumber></element>)
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <element name="U" massNumber atomicNumber></element> &rarr;

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>
    <li><u><b>Beta-minus decay (&beta;&minus;)</b></u> - When the nucleus has too many neutrons, the weak force coverts a down quark to an up quark, thus creating a proton. Since charge is conserved, it creates a positive and negative charge, the electron
        is then emitted as the Beta-minus particle (
        <element atomicNumber="&minus;1" massNumber="0" name="&beta;"></element> or
        <element atomicNumber="&minus;1" massNumber="0" name="<var>e</var>"></element>)

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </li>
    <li><u><b>Beta-plus decay (&beta;+)</b></u> - When the nucleus has too many protons, the weak force changes an up quark to a down quark, essentially making a proton into a neutron. Since charge is conserved, it emits a postive charge (
        <element atomicNumber="1" massNumber="0" name="&beta;"></element> or
        <element atomicNumber="1" massNumber="0" name="<var>e</var>"></element>) called a positron&mdash;it is the antimatter of an electron.

<h3>2-D Collisions:</h3>
<li>Last year we focused on 1-dimensional collisions with Kinetic Energy and Momentum, but it's just as easy to extend that to 2-dimensions.</li>
<li>Since Kinetic Energy is a scalar value, you just add the values no matter what direction</li>
<li>However, since momentum is a vector, you need to break apart the momentum vectors into x- and y-components before using the conservation of momentum</li>
