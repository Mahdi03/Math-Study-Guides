    <h3>Special Relativity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed is relative, only the speed of light remains constant.</li>
        <li>Time is also relative to the observer (moving clocks run slower). This effect is known as <u>Time Dilation</u>.</li>
        <li>The following equation find the factor by which to dilate time or length, using the velocity and the speed of light:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td>&gamma; =
                    <div class="fraction">
                        <div class="top">1</div>
                        <div class="bottom">
                            <sqrt>1 &minus;
                                <div class="fraction">
                                    <div class="top"><var>v</var><sup>2</sup></div>
                                    <div class="bottom"><var>c</var><sup>2</sup></div>
                                </div>
                            </sqrt>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>Typically we assume that the observeris always at rest and everything else around them is what moves.</li>
        <li>When objects move fast relative to the speed of light, lengths get shorter in the dierction of movement (meaning that it moves horizontally but vertical length stays the same). This is known as <u>length contraction</u></li>
        <li>In any situation, two different observers will always agree on their relative speeds to each other and the absolute speed of light.</li>
        <li>In AP Physics 1 we learned <var>p = mv</var>, but when we reach relativistic speeds (speeds closer to the speed of light <var>c</var>) we need to correct this formula to:</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td><var>p = &gamma;mv</var></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h5>Law of Conservation of Mass-Energy:</h5>
        <li>Einstein figured out that mass was just highly compressed energy, and formed the correct relation between energy, mass and speed</li>
        <table class="rules">
            <tr>
                <td><var>E = &gamma;mc</var><sup>2</sup></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <li>When <var>v</var> = 0, or when the object is at rest, the formula boils down to a more familiar <var>E = mc</var><sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>At really low speeds we can use Newtonian Mechanics to approximate the energy of an object to be <var>E = mc</var><sup>2</sup> +
            <div class="fraction">
                <div class="top">1</div>
                <div class="bottom">2</div>
            </div><var>mv</var><sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>Using the above formula we can find how much energy is released in nuclear reactions in the form of mass lost.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>General Relativity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Acceleration is accompanied by forces, the observer that is accelerating feels the time dilation and the length contraction.</li>
        <li>While Special Relativity deals with differences in velocities, it's all inertial. General Relativity deals with acceleration.</li>
        <li>Accelerating feels like an external gravitational field, and all physics falls under this equivalence principle.</li>
        <li>If you accelerate at a relativistic rate, a light beam will curve as if it were undergoing projectile motion. Therefore we can deduce that gravtiy makes light curve (this effect is known as <u>Gravitational Lensing</u>)</li>
    </ul>
